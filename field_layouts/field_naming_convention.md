# Field naming convention

## Single row scenarios

Filename `{Nf}f_0` 

These layouts have a single row of `Nf` fields, e.g., 5f_0 is:

```
XXXXX
```

## Two row scenarios

Filename `{Nf}f_{Nu}{shift}`

These layouts have two rows, with `Nf` total fields and `Nu` fields in
the upper row. A letter `shift` indicates the shift of the top row
relative to the bottom. E.g., 7f_2a is:

```
XX
XXXXX
```
